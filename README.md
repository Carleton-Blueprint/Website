# CUBluePrint's New Website 

Our new and updated website for CUBluePrint!

You can find our live website available at: [link](enter link here thanks)



## Motivation for Project

In 2021, we decided to build our club a brand new website with an improved UI and a more modern tech stack. The reason for this change was that our old website was built with Pug and had outdated design decisions.

To meet these challenges, our team designed a [new UI using Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Qt7bGynNItu0hUvPu0EPGa/Draft-Website-Design?node-id=0%3A1) and is currently working on developing it using React, Typescript and styled components. 



## Site Map

Our site contains information about CUBlueprint's mission statement, our current projects, our team, how to get involved and sign up forms for volunteers and non-profit organizations. 

The following is a visual map of how to navigate our website:

## How to run the website in Development

To run the project in development mode on a local server, run the following command inside the project directory:

### `yarn start`

This command will run the app on default [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). It can be accessed via a web browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
