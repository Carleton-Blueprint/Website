They also provide financial coaching for eligible clients. When we partnered with Beneficent in 2020, they were a small team with a growing client base, and were previously using multiple tools to track their loan processes (excel sheets, trello, slack). This became very inefficient and unorganized, and creating the need for a centralized solution to manage their clientele.',

It had a separate catagory to track pending transactions, their status and a payment calendar for each client. The solution also featured a separate tab to track client and account manager information.',
